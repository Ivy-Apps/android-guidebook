# Android Guidebook

> An opinionated collection of learnings from my Android experience as a founding engineer in 4 startups and a contractor at Toptal and Reddit.

Android Development is, before all, software engineering, which, like any engineering field, is based on science. And when it comes to science, math, and formal logic rule the game. So in this guidebook, we'll look into the Android Development and software engineering best practices through the lens of science.

So before we begin, we need to get familiar with the formal language.

## Formal language

### Implications

An **implication** is a one-way logical statement that takes the form "if P, then Q", often written as `P ⇒ Q`. Here:

- P is the **cause** or **assumption** (what we start with).
- Q is the **result** (what follows if P is true).

Think of it this way: "If it rains, then the ground is wet." In logic terms, this is `P ⇒ Q` where:

- P: "It rains."
- Q: "The ground is wet."

This means if it’s raining, we can be sure the ground is wet. However, the reverse isn’t always true: if the ground is wet, it doesn’t guarantee it has rained—it could be a sprinkler or someone washing the street.

So, an implication is one-way: `P ⇒ Q` does not mean `Q ⇒ P`. This is a key part of formal logic that helps build precise reasoning.
